We implemented Decision Trees method to identify six basic emotions from the human facial techniques expressions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise)
based on a labelled set of facial Action Units(AUs).

## Installation & How to run

The program was tested using MATLAB R2017a.

To run testTree functions on the stored tree object (`tree_set.mat`), run
`main.m`

In order to execute k-fold cross-validation and generate various values, run
`Decision_Trees.m`
